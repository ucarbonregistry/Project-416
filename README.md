27.5 MW Biomass Based Grid Connected Electricity Generation Project at DCM Shriram, Limited, Sugar Unit : Ajbapur

The project “27.5 MW Biomass Based Grid Connected Electricity Generation Project at DCM
Shriram Limited, Sugar Unit :Ajbapur ” is located in Village Ajbapur, Post Office Mullapur, District
Lakhimpur kheri, State Uttar Pradesh, Country India.

The project activity is developed by M/s DCM Shriram Limited, Sugar Unit Ajbapur in village
Ajbapur, P.O Mullapur, Lakhimpur Kheri, Uttar Pradesh, India. Project activity involves installation
of one 7.5 MW and one 20 MW extraction cum condensing turbine in their existing facility to generate
renewable electricity from bagasse and other biomass residue. Generated electricity would be sold to
regional electricity grid. Plant has upgraded it’s one 50 TPH boiler to 75 TPH and commissioned two
new high pressure boiler of capacity 60 TPH each. Generated electricity would be evacuated to the
grid via 132 kV step-up substation. Plant has signed PPA with Madhyanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam
Limited for a capacity of 24 MW and expected to operate at 80% capacity utilization factor.

The purpose of the project activity is to generate electricity from renewable resource and supply it to
national grid. The project activity involves upgradation of one existing boiler and installation of two
new 60 TPH high pressure energy efficient boiler and installation of two new turbine of capacity 7.5
MW and 20 MW. The first 7.5 MW turbine was commissioned on 12/04/2005. Other two boilers were
commissioned on 03/12/2005 and 09/12/2006 and the 20 MW turbine was commissioned on
02/02/2007. DCM Shriram Limited, Sugar Unit Ajbapur is the sole owner of this project activity.
Plant has signed a PPA with Madhyanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited to sells the surplus electricity
to the state dis-com.

In absence of the project activity, equivalent amount of electricity which is supplied by this project
activity would have otherwise been supplied to the grid by fossil fuel based power plant connected to
the grid. The project activity is expected to supply 168,192 MWh of electricity to the national grid
each year. Hence, the project activity is expected to reduce the anthropogenic emission by 151,372 tCO2/Year.
The project activity reduces GHG emissions which is correlated with United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals (SDG) 13 (Climate action). Beside this the project activity addresses multiple
other UN developed SDGs.
